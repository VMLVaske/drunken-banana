# Ghost Blog on EC2 (with Terraform + GitHub Actions)

This project provisions and deploys a production-ready Ghost blogging platform on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and GitHub Actions. It automates infrastructure creation, bootstraps the Ghost container, adds scheduled backups, and supports redeployment via CI/CD.

## ‚úÖ Features Completed

[] Create a new user with home directory + SSH identity
[x] Install Ghost application + dependencies
[x] Setup the firewall to only allow SSH and Ghost traffic through
[x] Setup a cron-job that:
    [x] dumps the database
    [x] saves a snapshot of the production site under /backup directory
    [x] mails you a summary every night
[x] Create a way for developers to push new changes to Ghost in an easy and repeatable way

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

[x] submit Git repo with Terraform manifest(s) (or any other automation system code) to provision and configure the VM instance.
[x] very clear instructions for the developers on how they can provision this new infrastructure from scratch to deploy their own Ghost instance, push changes and view them.
[x] A paragraph reflecting on the solution and pointing out what can be improved given more time going forward.

## üåü Future Improvements

* use a custom domain - this would also allow for SSL certification. Currently we're rolling with a ElasticIP, so we cannot add the necessary certifications.

## üéì Lessons Learned

Ghost uses MySQL by default; to switch to sqlite3 you need to specify `database_client`and `database_connection_filename`in the docker-compose.
Without any dedicated mention, Ghost will default back to MySQL continuously, even when deleting the content dir and the config.json, and crash the container hard.

Docker Compose must use `url=http://localhost` unless you're behind NGINX

Interactive apt installs like postfix must be pre-seeded using debconf-set-selections, because otherwise the gh actions will get stuck in waiting mode, as the postfix dialogue never closes.
This gets ugly if you encounter a deadlock situation, in which you'll either have to restart the entire EC2 or remove the dangling hooks manually.

Elastic IPs will change unless declared in Terraform and attached as a separate resource.

GitHub Actions need a stable SSH user and key‚Äîthis required generating and base64-encoding a separate deploy key.
On mac, this needs to be done with openssl ;)

Ghost serves on port 2368 by default. To make the blog reachable via port 80, NGINX is installed and configured as a reverse proxy in `setup.sh`. Without this, users would need to access the site using `http://IP:2368`.

## üìÉ MISC Notes

Important: By April 2025, AWS EC2 no longer has a general free tier. The t2.micro or t3.micro instances used in this project will incur costs unless your AWS account is still within the first 12 months of creation (Free Tier eligibility).

Be sure to:

Shut down the instance after testing

Use terraform destroy if you‚Äôre not using it long-term

Monitor your AWS billing dashboard if unsure

## ‚ú® How it Works

* terraform apply provisions the EC2 instance, security group, and elastic IP.
* a userdata.sh script is rendered from a template and injected, doing the following:
* Installs Docker & Docker Compose
* Clones this repo to /home/ubuntu/drunken-banana
* Creates a deployer user with SSH access using a Terraform variable
* On any push to main, GitHub Actions:
* * SSHes into the instance as deployer
* * Pulls the latest repo changes
* * Re-runs setup.sh to restart Ghost and cronjobs
* * Backups run every 15 minutes (can be changed to nightly), creating .tar.gz files and emailing metadata to the configured address.

## üßµ SSH Key Management

The EC2 instance accepts a Terraform-provided SSH keypair for initial ubuntu access.

A separate deployer key is injected via terraform.tfvars and used only by GitHub Actions.

The deployer key is stored in GitHub Secrets as base64 (EC2_DEPLOY_KEY_B64).

To regenerate and base64 your key:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ghost-deployer-key -N ""
base64 ghost-deployer-key | pbcopy # or use `openssl base64` if on mac

Add the result as a GitHub Secret, and keep the .pub version in terraform.tfvars.

### EC2 Recreation: What to do

If the EC2 instance is destroyed (e.g. due to terraform destroy or a new terraform apply), you‚Äôll need to:

[] Update the public IP in .github/workflows/deploy.yml (lines 22 & 26)
[] Ensure the GitHub Action's deploy key is injected into the instance:
  * SSH into the instance manually with the Terraform-generated key
  * Append the public part of the deployer key into `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  * Then re-run the GitHub Action by pushing to `main`

This keeps CI/CD functional across infra refreshes.

## üöÄ Deploy Your Own

cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
Fill in your public key + deployer key + your preferred backup email address
`terraform init`
`terraform apply`

Push to main and watch GitHub Actions take over!

## üë©‚Äçüíª How Developers Use It

Developers can treat the Ghost platform like any normal Ghost installation:

Log in at `http://<elastic-ip>/ghost`
Create and edit posts via the Ghost Admin UI
All content is stored in ghost-content/, which is persisted via Docker volume
Changes are backed up automatically via cron
Infrastructure or config changes can be made via Git commits ‚Üí pushed to main ‚Üí deployed via GitHub Actions
Developers don‚Äôt need to SSH into the instance or touch AWS directly. They just write, commit, and deploy ‚Äî everything else is handled automatically.
